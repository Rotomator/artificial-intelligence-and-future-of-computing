  Last year, a curious nonfiction book became a Times best-seller: a dense
  meditation on artificial intelligence by the philosopher Nick Bostrom, who
  holds an appointment at Oxford. Titled "Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers,
  Strategies," it argues that true artificial intelligence, if it is realized,
  might pose a danger that exceeds every previous threat from technology-even
  nuclear weapons-and that if its development is not managed carefully humanity
  risks engineering its own extinction.
