  If you want to understand the personality of a material, study its electrons.
  Table salt forms cubic crystals because its atoms share electrons in that
  configuration; silver shines because its electrons absorb visible light and
  reradiate it back. Electron behavior causes nearly all material properties:
  hardness, conductivity, melting temperature.
