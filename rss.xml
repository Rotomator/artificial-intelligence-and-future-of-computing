            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Matter will be created from light within a year, claim scientists</h1><p>Researchers have worked out how to make matter from pure light and are drawing up plans to demonstrate the feat within the next 12 months. The theory underpinning the idea was first described 80 years ago by two physicists who later worked on the first atomic bomb.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f7d1e41b723f4996ec82e646cea047e4/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.guim.co.uk%2Fimg%2Fstatic%2Fsys-images%2FLifeandhealth%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2009%2F10%2F23%2F1256296498769%2FSplit-laser-beam-001.jpg%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D630%26q%3D55%26auto%3Dformat%26usm%3D12%26fit%3Dcrop%26bm%3Dnormal%26ba%3Dbottom%252Cleft%26blend64%3DaHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n%26s%3D7aeadd665340df7be89e5dc4a8d24eb1"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Part 1 - The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence</h1><p>Nothing will make you appreciate human intelligence like learning about how unbelievably challenging it is to try to create a computer as smart as we are. Building skyscrapers, putting humans in space, figuring out the details of how the Big Bang went down—all far easier than understanding our own brain or how to make something as cool as it. As of now, the human brain is the most complex object in the known universe.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/908af409-c74d-4921-821b-f8e26420868e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Part 2 - The AI Revolution: Our Immortality or Extinction</h1><p>Evolution has advanced the biological brain slowly and gradually over hundreds of millions of years, and in that sense, if humans birth an ASI machine, we’ll be dramatically stomping on evolution. Or maybe this is part of evolution—maybe the way evolution works is that intelligence creeps up more and more until it hits the level where it’s capable of creating machine superintelligence, and that level is like a tripwire that triggers a worldwide game-changing explosion that determines a new future for all living things</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2b7054d2-1063-4edc-b319-196cd7332504.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Banks, futuristic post-humans install devices on their brains called a "neural lace." A mesh that grows with your brain, it's essentially a wireless brain-computer interface. But it's also a way to program your neurons to release certain chemicals with a thought.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6c9d7290ab196a3113a05d5e1188cd72/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kinja-img.com%2Fgawker-media%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fs--W6PuRBfh--%2Fc_fill%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_450%2Cq_80%2Cw_800%2F1298870262105595053.jpg"></article>]]></description>
